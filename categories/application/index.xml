      <description>Creating executable for small embedded application can be tedious, especially if the plateform is not supporting executing compilation toochains.
Creating cross executable with RUST In first place, creating an executable using rust is quite simple the typical steps are :
 use rustup to add the target plateform, using the triplet describing the hardware, and system use the cargo build --target &amp;lt;TRIPLET&amp;gt;  command line to build  Thank&amp;rsquo;s to the community , these command line are easy to use and launch.</description>

      <description>This prototype is an expermiment for adding to the smart home system, some additional capabilities to monitor plants and growing plants.
The IOT Growing plant station The growing plant is hosted in the living room, and permit us to grow seeds before planting them on the outside. The growth rate has been observed to be about 4 time faster than outside growth. There are still ways of improvment but gives good results in preparing and growing aromatic plants or even small vegetables.</description>
