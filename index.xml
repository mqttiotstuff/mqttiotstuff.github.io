      <description>When expanding the intelligence and capabilities of a smart home, it becomes essential to have access to historical data. This data plays a crucial role in triggering new behaviors based on past events and triggers. By archiving these events, it becomes possible to enhance and fine-tune the smart home&amp;rsquo;s behavior, while also recognizing the inherent value of maintaining a historical record.
When faced with the challenge of storing a large volume of events, it can be particularly daunting for individuals with limited knowledge in computer science or those who prefer not to spend excessive time administering complex platforms for event archiving.</description>

      <description>Creating executable for small embedded application can be tedious, especially if the plateform is not supporting executing compilation toochains.
Creating cross executable with RUST In first place, creating an executable using rust is quite simple the typical steps are :
 use rustup to add the target plateform, using the triplet describing the hardware, and system use the cargo build --target &amp;lt;TRIPLET&amp;gt;  command line to build  Thank&amp;rsquo;s to the community , these command line are easy to use and launch.</description>

      <description>In this more practical followup article, we&amp;rsquo;ll focus on the led language implementation using python. Led box permit to display some led animation using an individually controlled led strip using ws2812 chip.
Hightly configurable animations implementation is shown and presented here, using python generators functions. This article, aims to explain the benefits of such approach in creating the grammar for smart led animations and smart feedback for such devices.</description>

      <description>IOTMonitor project What&amp;rsquo;s new on version 0.2.2:
On the 0.2.2 version, several small enhacements : - Mqtt client specification on the config.toml - building from docker, either release and dev zig version  IotMonitor is an effortless and lightweight mqtt monitoring for devices (IOT things) and agents (software mqtt client) on Linux.
IotMonitor aims to solve the &amp;ldquo;always up&amp;rdquo; problem of large IOT devices and agents system. This project is successfully used every day for running smart home automation system.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When informations and alerts are too much invasive in every day life, leading to high cognitive loads. Having the right information at the right time in the right place is the key to be efficient and preserve stress free attitudes. Designing Calm Technology IOT devices are nowadays mandatory to integrate such logics at home, to stay comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Time Expression RegExp triggers to improve meaning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Compilation and Language Theory&lt;/code&gt; is a way to transform &amp;ldquo;Low level&amp;rdquo; informations into a more evolved action. This ability, in the ambiant and intelligent systems,  leverage the summarizing sparsed actions or &amp;ldquo;events&amp;rdquo;, into a more human understandable meaning. This decomposition raise the information to a more evolved semantic that can help design more sophisticated logics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applications of these tools also enhance and extend already existing devices, adding timed based actions triggering. As an example, a simple device button can then understand long pressures, or fast sequences that can be transformed in different actions ( in the same way the &lt;a href=&#34;https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Morse_international&#34;&gt;Morse Code&lt;/a&gt; has been setted up in the 19th century for transmissing Textual messages, using a simple tone).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This prototype is an expermiment for adding to the smart home system, some additional capabilities to monitor plants and growing plants.
The IOT Growing plant station The growing plant is hosted in the living room, and permit us to grow seeds before planting them on the outside. The growth rate has been observed to be about 4 time faster than outside growth. There are still ways of improvment but gives good results in preparing and growing aromatic plants or even small vegetables.</description>

      <title>Experiment around LedBoxes</title>
      <link>https://mqttiotstuff.github.io/post/mqtt-agent-ledbox/</link>

      <guid>https://mqttiotstuff.github.io/post/mqtt-agent-ledbox/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working part of my time at home, i needed to be informed about all my systems in a non invasive way,  following the calm technology trend to stay focus on my primary working task. With this orientation,  I&amp;rsquo;ve then conduct some experiments building a new device standing on the desk and bring system informations and alerts i choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how the ledbox came in. I&amp;rsquo;ve just wished to experiment in practice the affordance of such device and its communication ability and attention retention. This device is composed of a led banner rolled in a semi transparent box, and also containing a body sensor and 4 touch buttons on the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mqttiotstuff/MyMQTTNodeIOT/master/hardware/SimpleDevice05/ledbox2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This device is connected to MQTT brocker, and receive the leds status to display. A bit rought at the first glace, but the work on the user&amp;rsquo;s experience bring interesting points on using low light displays and smooth transitions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mqtt iot system bring value in every day&amp;rsquo;s life. This is because of the existing agents that help system live.
Some agents have been freed in repository, for preview. As my own system grow and used,  there are still semantic maturing, and testing.
These implementation are in python 3, to ease the read and let users understand and extend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
