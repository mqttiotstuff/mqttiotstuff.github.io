      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while the ledbox is working, and really gives usefull calm informations each day.  As a new design is currently on progress, here are some revealed  details about the building.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using heterogeneous systems, lead to creating dictionaries of existing sensors and actuators, leverage and extend their usages for intelligent ambiant systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll cover a use of such description, on smart home system,  based on W3C standards and Onthologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LedBox language animation building blocks</title>

      <description>In this more practical followup article, we&amp;rsquo;ll focus on the led language implementation using python. Led box permit to display some led animation using an individually controlled led strip using ws2812 chip.
Hightly configurable animations implementation is shown and presented here, using python generators functions. This article, aims to explain the benefits of such approach in creating the grammar for smart led animations and smart feedback for such devices.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Watching for BlueTooth devices, or Beacon as well as Wifi stations, can be easily done, using a simple ESP32 device.  Several applications of this capability :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indoor location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presence detection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyber watching the around wifi devices, or stations&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Growing Plant Prototype Station</title>
      <link>https://mqttiotstuff.github.io/post/growing-plant/</link>

      <description>This prototype is an expermiment for adding to the smart home system, some additional capabilities to monitor plants and growing plants.
The IOT Growing plant station The growing plant is hosted in the living room, and permit us to grow seeds before planting them on the outside. The growth rate has been observed to be about 4 time faster than outside growth. There are still ways of improvment but gives good results in preparing and growing aromatic plants or even small vegetables.</description>

      <title>Experiment around LedBoxes</title>
      <link>https://mqttiotstuff.github.io/post/mqtt-agent-ledbox/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working part of my time at home, i needed to be informed about all my systems in a non invasive way,  following the calm technology trend to stay focus on my primary working task. With this orientation,  I&amp;rsquo;ve then conduct some experiments building a new device standing on the desk and bring system informations and alerts i choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how the ledbox came in. I&amp;rsquo;ve just wished to experiment in practice the affordance of such device and its communication ability and attention retention. This device is composed of a led banner rolled in a semi transparent box, and also containing a body sensor and 4 touch buttons on the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mqttiotstuff/MyMQTTNodeIOT/master/hardware/SimpleDevice05/ledbox2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This device is connected to MQTT brocker, and receive the leds status to display. A bit rought at the first glace, but the work on the user&amp;rsquo;s experience bring interesting points on using low light displays and smooth transitions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
