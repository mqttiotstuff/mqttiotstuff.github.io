      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working part of my time at home, i needed to bring some non invasive informations about my systems, taking informations from calm technologies, i&amp;rsquo;d like to experiment bit a new device sitting on the desk and inform about system alerts i choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how the ledbox came in. I would like to experiment in practice the affordance of such device. This device is composed of a led banner rolled in a semi transparent box, and also containing a body sensor and a bunch of sensitive buttons at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/mqttiotstuff/MyMQTTNodeIOT/blob/master/hardware/SimpleDevice05/ledbox2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This device is connected to MQTT brocker, and receive the leds status to display. A bit rought at the first glade, but working on the experience broad some interesting feedback using low display lights and smooth transitions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mqtt iot system bring value in every day&amp;rsquo;s life. This is because of the existing agents that help system live.
Some agents have been freed in repository, for preview. As my own system grow and used,  there are still semantic maturing, and testing.
These implementation are in python 3, to ease the read and let users understand and extend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This project is a simple state manager and monitoring system for MQTT based communication devices (IOT). Iotmonitor monitor the existing devices, using a config file.
IotMonitor also record and restore their states as they go and recover. It helps to maintain IOT things working, even if they fails.
Each device has an independent communication message time out, when the device did not reponse until timeout is reached, the iotmonitor publish a specific monitoring failure topic for the device, with the latest contact timestamp</description>
